# Dev Server

### **_Description_**

Open a local development server on http://localhost:8080 for previewing your website/project. Super Useful for Frontend Development.

### **_Usage_**:

- Command: `tt misc dev start` OR `tt misc dev stop`
- Aliases: `tt misc devserver`

With this function, You can easily preview your website/project Instantly!

P.S: I am currently working for some mechanism so it automatically refreshes if some change is detected in the files in the user's CWD (Curent Working Directory).
